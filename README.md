# php-ext-xz

PHP Extension providing XZ (LZMA2) compression/decompression functions.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the extension is using [pie](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pie.intro.php):

```bash
pie install mateuszanella/php-ext-xz
```

This will download the source and compile the extension for your current PHP version. After installing the module, you may need to enable it in your `php.ini` file.
****
## Configuration

### php.ini

Add the following line to your `php.ini` configuration file:

```ini
extension=xz.so
```

You can also configure the default compression level and memory limit:

```ini

; Default compression level. Affects `xzencode` and `xzopen`, 
; but only when the level was not specified. Default is 5.
xz.compression_level=5

; The maximum amount of memory that can be used when decompressing. Default is 0 (no limit).
xz.max_memory=65536
```

## Build from Source

For detailed build and installation instructions from source, please see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Basic usage

### String-based operations

You can easily compress and decompress strings.

```php
$originalString = 'This is a test string that will be compressed and then decompressed.';

// Compress a string
$compressed = xzencode($originalString);

// Decompress a string
$decompressed = xzdecode($compressed);
```

### File-based operations

The extension also supports stream-based operations for working with `.xz` files.

```php
$file = '/tmp/test.xz';

// Writing to an .xz file
$wh = xzopen($file, 'w');
xzwrite($wh, 'Data to write');
xzclose($wh);

// Reading from an .xz file and outputting its contents
$rh = xzopen($file, 'r');
xzpassthru($rh);
xzclose($rh);
```
